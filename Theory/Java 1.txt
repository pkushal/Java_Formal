String Class:
------------
It is a inbuilt class in Java (google for java api).
public final class String extends Object implements Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence

String are immutable. It is in the package java.lang.String. String is a class  not a datatype.
When ever we do:
	String name = "Java";  name is a object of String class 
	String name = new String ("Java"); is same as the first type of declaration.

	Char c = "J"; here c is variable because Char is a data type.

Once we create a string object, we cannot change it because it create a new memory location of that object, we are doing new operation

String is not a datatype, but a Object type.
If methods are in same class, we don't need object to invoke them, just make
sure you are not invoking a static methods.
Static method cannot call non-static methods but can make calls to the other static memnbers

charAt(int index)
indexOf(char c): position of character c
s.toUpperCase();
s.toLowerCase();
s.substring(int begin, int end);
s.length();
s.equals(String t); // to compare two Strings by value: this is case sensitive
if(s == t) is not valid, it will compare the objects not the values
s.equalsIgnoreCase(String t);


It is not a good idea to count the index to make a substring, so
we do like,

	String s = "string";
	int begin = s.indexOf("s");
	int stop = s.indexOf("g");
	String sub = s.subString(begin, stop);



Exception Handling:
-------------------

Syntax error
Logic error
Run time error

try(...)
catch (<Exception Class> e)
{
 // some code
}
catch()
{
	...
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	System.out.println("This is a general catch...")
	System.out.println(e.stacktrace());
}
When ever an exception occurs, Java will create an object of Exception class.
Catch block will catch the exception object and we need to do the corrective
action. The lines of code after the catch block will be normally executed.

One try can have multiple level of catch but make sure that you are aware of 
the order, put the super class exception at last.


throw and throws:
-----------------
When the calling a method, throw will give the exception object back to the caller.

Inside some method:
catch(InputMismatchException e){
	throw e;
}

And the caller will do like:

try{
	K.add();
}
catch(InputMismatchException e){
 System.out.println("Please try again: ");
 K.add();
}
This thing will go on as long as the user enters the correct input.

To let other know that some method throws exception is using throws keyword in the method and 
it also tell that it will not handle the exception but  throw the exception back to the caller.

void add() throws InputMismatchException{
	//some code
	try{
		//some code
	}
	catch(InputMismatchException e){
		throw e;
	}
	finally{
		//some code
	}
}

throw will throw the exception and throws will tell java that some exception may happen inside me but I am not 
handling the exception.

We will use throw when we want to have control over the program flow. In some
normal case, we can just specify throws in the method and nothing else in there. Caller will do all work

finally:
the code inside the finally block will always be executed. It ensures that the code inside the finally block will be
executed before the control goes to somewhere from the catch block.


Checked and Unchecked exception:
---------------------------------

Checked Exception: are the direct subclasses of exception class except Runtime exception class
					It will for the programmer to handle the exception

Unchecked Exception: Runtime exception and it's subclasses are unchecked
					 Java will not give compilation error even if we do not exception handling
					 Java will not force the programmer to handle the exception.







Java I/O:
----------

All modern I/O are stream based.
Stream is a connection to a source of data or to a destination
for data.
An input stream may be associtated with the keyboard or with a file.
There is input and output stream.
Java has inbuilt classes to make a connection with input sources like keyboard, mouse etc
Package	: import java.io.*
	Open the stream
	Use the stream (read, write or both)
	Close the stream

Java I/O has:
	1. InputStream
		 like xxxInputStream
	2. OutputStream
		 like xxxOutputStream
	3. Reader
	      like xxxReader
	4. Writer
		  like xxxWriter

To do some read operation, we can use the InputStream or 
the Reader. Same for the write operation.


InputStream and Output supports ASCII
Reader and writer supports UTF-8

ASCII cannot read like chinese, french format
UTF-8 supports everything.
Audio, image, video cannot be used with UTF-8, need to use ASCII.
For texts, generally use the UTF-8.
The difference is the encoding and character formats.


File class:
-----------
java.io.file
It help to perform operations on the file like make 
read, copy, delete but not create the connection stream

import java.io.file
File f = new File("C:\\wala\\fileio\\test.txt");
try{
	f.createNewFile();
	System.out.println("File created");
	boolean cr = f.canRead(); // can read permission
	boolean c2 = f.canWrite(); // can write permission
	boolean d = f.isDirectory();// will tell if it is a directory
	f.length(); // will give the size of the file
	f.delete(); // will delete the file

}
catch(IOException e){
	System.out.println("File already exists");
	e.printStackTrace();
}
finally{
	f.close();
}
// this will create an empty file called test.txt in the at location

See the methods in the File class from the java api



If we have directory in the file object, then
File f = new File("C:\\wala\\fileio");
File files[]=f.listFiles();
// it will create array of file object for all the file in that directory.
for(int i=0; i<files.length; i++){
	System.out.println(files[i].getName());
}

Read and Write operation on a file:
-----------------------------------

FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("C:\\wala\\fileio\\test.txt");// this needs to be in the try catch block
int value =f.read();
// this will read a single character from the file
// this will give the ASCII value of first character
char c = (char) f.read();
int k;
while((k=f.read())!=-1){
	// read method will return -1 when it reaches  end of the file
	char c =(char) k;
	// do not do read here again else it will escapr character...think
	System.out.println(c);
}
f.close();

This class is not efficient. So lets use FileReader or BuffererdReader.

FileReader class:
------------------
FileReader f = new FileReader("C:\\wala\\fileio\\test.txt");
//Other operation is same.
BuffererdReader br = new BuffererdReader(f);
// BuffererdReader internally implements  FileReader..to avoid reading char by char
//It will read char by char and gives line by line... it buffers the characters 
// Increases the performance
Both FileReader and BuffererdReader needs to be in the try catch block

String str = br.readLine();


String s;
while(s= br.readLine()!= null){
// end of the file is null, -1 in the last case
	System.out.println(s);
	// don't read here again, it will skip line
}
