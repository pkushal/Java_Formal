String Class:
------------
It is a inbuilt class in Java (google for java api).
public final class String extends Object implements Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence

String are immutable. It is in the package java.lang.String. String is a class  not a datatype.
When ever we do:
	String name = "Java";  name is a object of String class 
	String name = new String ("Java"); is same as the first type of declaration.

	Char c = "J"; here c is variable because Char is a data type.

Once we create a string object, we cannot change it because it create a new memory location of that object, we are doing new operation
